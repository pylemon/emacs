* Using org-mode to manage emacs configure files

** clone the repo to your machine
   #+begin_src shell
   $ git clone git://github.com/pylemon/emacs.git   
   #+end_src

** run the compile script
   the compile script will complile the el file into elc file, and it
   will overwrite the ~/.emacs file, so please backup your ~/.emacs
   file before do this. this can make the emacs daemon running much
   more faster!
   #+begin_src shell
   $ ./compile
   #+end_src

** notice
   - all the third-part libs are in *lisps* folder
   - all the configuration are in *emacs-config.org* file
